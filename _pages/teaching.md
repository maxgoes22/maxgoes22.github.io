In my teaching, I strive to impart knowledge to students in such a way that they can transfer and apply it to new problems beyond the specific context of the course

The focus of my teaching to date has been on microeconomics and methodological training, including the basics of microeconomics, industrial organization and game theory.

For the summer semester 2024, I have taught a master's and doctoral lecture (with accompanying seminar) called *Applied Machine Learning in Economics*, in which both the theory and the application of various machine learning and casual inference methods to economics have been discussed.

I have put two course on github, click <a href='https://github.com/maxgoes22/Data-Science-1-Tutorial'>here</a> for a course on python basics and <a href='https://github.com/maxgoes22/Data-Science-2-Tutorial'>here</a> for an introduction course on machine learning topics.

In the future, I plan to share the material for courses I taught on this page.
