Hello, World! I am Max. I am a micro-economist with an interest in machine learning, laboratory experiments and game theory.

My current work focuses on questions on the effect of institutions on cooperation in social dilemmas with primary applications to the study of oligopolies. 
In oligopolies, policy makers and competition authorities aim to inhibit cooperation or collusion between firms because their collusive actions come at the cost of social welfare, for example, by causing higher prices. 

With my work, I hope to protect or even to foster social welfare.

You can find my published work here, my work in progress here, my teaching here, my Google Scholar profile here and my CV here.

If you have any question, you can contact me via maximilian.andres(at)uni-potsdam(dot)de

See you ðŸ˜Š
