Hello, World! I am Max. I am a micro-economist with an interest in machine learning, laboratory experiments and game theory.

My current work focuses on questions concerning the effect of institutions on <span style="background-color:black; color:white;">cooperation in social dilemmas</span> with primary applications to the study of oligopolies. 
In oligopolies, policy makers and competition authorities aim to inhibit cooperation or collusion between firms because their collusive actions come at the cost of social welfare, for example, by causing higher prices. 

In 2023, I was awarded the Heinz-Sauermann Award of the German Association for Experimental Economic Research for the best Ph.D. thesis in experimental economics between 2022 and 2023.

You can find more information on my work here on this website.

See you ðŸ˜Š
